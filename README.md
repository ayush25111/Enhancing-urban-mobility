Enhancing urban mobility: Integrating ride-sharing and public transit

Introduction of the case study:-
Seamless integration of ride-sharing and public transit may offer fast, reliable, and affordable transfer to and from stations in urban areas thereby easing and enhancing mobility of people. The potential benefits of such a system is to have cheaper and more environmentally sustainable alternative is to use existing private car trips as a feeder for public transit. Ride-sharing and public transit can, in fact, complement each other. On the one hand, ride-sharing can serve as a feeder system that connects less densely populated areas to public transit. On the other hand, the public transit system can extend the reach of ride-sharing and reduce the alone time of the drivers. Our goal is to achieve the optimal solution for the models we are implementing and to show the integration of a ride-sharing system and a public transit system can significantly ease and enhance mobility, and increase the use of public transport and how the different types of ride matching problem needs to be handled differently according to the constraints, they subjected to.

Types of Ride Matching:

A ride-share match: a match between a rider and a driver in which the driver transports the rider from his origin to his destination.

A transit match: a match between a rider and a driver in which the driver transports the rider to a transit station. Subsequently, the driver drives to his destination while the rider takes public transit to reach his final destination.
